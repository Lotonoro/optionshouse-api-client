optionshouse-api-client is a simple python wrapper around the optionshouse
trading platform API. The goal of this project is to provide a working, but
minimal, non-magic interface to the API.

Disclaimer:
This API client has some test coverage, but has not gone through any real-world
use yet. I would strongly discourage anyone from using this to place real
orders at this time. If you use this software, you must assume all
responsibility for your actions and the actions of this software package.

==Basic Example Session
from session import Session
s = Session('myusername', 'mypassword')
s.open()
s.quote('GS')
s.close()

==Placing a Simple Order
s = Session('myusername', 'mypassword')
s.open()
order = Order(
  price_type='limit',
  time_in_force='good_till_cancel',
  price='72.50',
  underlying_stock_symbol='COP',
  legs=[
    OrderLeg(
        side='buy',
        security_type='stock',
        quantity=50,
        key='COP:::S',
        multiplier=1,
        position_type='opening',
    )
  ]
)

# Just supply your account id and your order object
s.preview_order(12345, order)

# Looks good? Go ahead and place it
s.place_order(12345, order)
s.close()

==Responses
All of the API requests have structured responses which vary. Take a look in
the tests folder for some examples.

==Supported API Methods
This API client supports all the documented optionshouse API actions. Each one
is available as a method on instances of Session:
* account_activity
* account_cash
* account_info
* account_positions
* cancel_order
* close
* issue_request
* keepalive
* list_orders
