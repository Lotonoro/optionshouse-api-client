optionshouse-api-client is a simple python wrapper around the optionshouse
trading platform API. The goal of this project is to provide a working, but
minimal, non-magic interface to the API.

==Example Session
from session import Session
s = Session('myusername', 'mypassword')
s.open()
s.quote('GS')
s.close()

==Supported API Methods
This API client supports all the documented optionshouse API actions. Each one
is available as a method on instances of Session:
* account_activity
* account_cash
* account_info
* account_positions
* cancel_order
* close
* issue_request
* keepalive
* list_orders
* modify_order
* open
* options_list
* parse_response
* place_order
* preview_order
* quote
